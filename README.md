# Building a Data-Driven App with AngularJS - with enhancements

This is an enhancement of the github repository of Ray Villalobos. [Ray Villalobos's GitHub](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/angulardata)
I have added some features just to enhance the experience , some just for fun and some just for learning concepts.

You can find all the details on how to install and how to run the application on Ray's github repo mentioned above. 

## Enhancements include:
- Send email for verification
- Forgot password link
- Login possible only if user is verified
- Fixed issue where badge was still visible after logging out
- Removed instances where $scope.message was still persistent after logging out.
- Application favicon added
- Fixed issue where meetings present would be showed only after user is loaded.

I have deployed/hosted the application on the link [AngularJSData](https://angularjsregistration.firebaseapp.com)
